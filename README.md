GitHub Tutorial

Hello World!
I'm Impmon51. I'm a college student, but I've programmed a little here & there since I was a teen. I'm very interested in game development. As a teen, I would make little text adventures. I'm still a beginner in programming, but I'd like to make much more interesting games & programs & post them on here!

The languages I used back as a teen were QBASIC & C. Recently in college, I learned some Python, but mostly we use Java & a little C++. I still a beginner in programming, so I would say I'm still learning all of these & would love to get really good at them.

I'm also very good at designing using CAD. In school I would use AutoCAD, but since that's expensive, at home I've since learned LibreCAD, & I've made a lot of little projects with that. I know that Github is mostly for software design, but I am curious if anyone is interested in seeing that.

I don't have anything in mind as far as colaborations at this moment. But if someone likes my skills & would like to colab, I'm very open to that!

You can reach me through here I think! If not, I might look for some way!
